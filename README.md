# Overview

I created this web app to practice and sharpen my skills as a web developer. This app allows users to search for recipes
by names. To start a test server, navigate to the project directory in the terminal and enter the 'npm start' command.
After that, the app can be accessed on localhost:3000 in your browser. I developed this app particularly to gain a
better understanding of React and APIs.

# Web Pages

The web app was made with 5 React Components I designed, and consists of 2 distinct views. The components include a
header, nav bar, search bar, search results, and recipe details. The primary view is made distinct by the search bar and
search results, while the other view contains the details for individual recipes. Transitioning between pages is managed
using React Router. The content on the Search and Recipe Details pages is dynamically generated based on user input and
API responses, with the Search page being populated by search results, and the Details page populated by the details of
the selected result.

# Development Environment

This project was developed in the WebStorm IDE. The app was built using React. Another library, React Router, was used
for navigation.

# Future Work

* A "Random Recipe" page
* A "Browse by Category" page
* More interactive styles (and a footer)
